      <h2>ðŸš€ My KWK Journey</h2>
      <p>
        Joining <strong>Kode with Klossy</strong> actually changed my life! It sparked my passion for coding and gave me a community of amazing coders and mentors. Iâ€™ve learned how to build real projects, collaborate, and bring my ideas to life. Plus, I love giving back by helping others learn the magic of code too! I recently was an AI/ML IA in Dallas and can't wait to do it again virtually in a few weeks!
